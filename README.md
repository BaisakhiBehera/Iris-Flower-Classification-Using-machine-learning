# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a simple web application that uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into different species based on input features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The classification model is built using a dataset of Iris flowers and is deployed in a web application using Flask.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for creating the user interface
- **Machine Learning**: The classification model is built using Python's `scikit-learn` library
